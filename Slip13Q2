Write a Java program to show lifecycle (creation, sleep, and dead) of a thread. Program
should print randomly the name of thread and value of sleep time. The name of the
thread should be hard coded through constructor. The sleep time of a thread will be a
random integer in the range 0 to 4999.

import java.util.Random;

public class ThreadLifecycle implements Runnable {
    
    private String threadName;
    
    public ThreadLifecycle(String name) {
        this.threadName = name;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread " + threadName + " created.");
        Random rand = new Random();
        int sleepTime = rand.nextInt(5000);
        System.out.println("Thread " + threadName + " will sleep for " + sleepTime + "ms.");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(sleepTime);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread " + threadName + " interrupted.");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println("Thread " + threadName + " is dead.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new ThreadLifecycle("Thread 1"));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new ThreadLifecycle("Thread 2"));
        Thread t3 = new Thread(new ThreadLifecycle("Thread 3"));
        
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
    }
}
